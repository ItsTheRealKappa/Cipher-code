# 🔐 Cipher Code Game

A simple text encryption and decryption game built in Python, based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This project was created as part of [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy.

## 📌 About

The Cipher Code Game allows users to encode or decode messages using a Caesar Cipher — a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

This fun and interactive command-line project helps build a strong understanding of:

* Python functions
* Loops and conditionals
* String manipulation
* User input handling

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user chooses whether to **encode** or **decode** a message.
2. The user inputs the **message** and a **shift number** (e.g. 3).
3. The program processes the input using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
4. The encrypted or decrypted message is printed to the screen.
5. The user is asked if they want to go again.

## 🧠 Caesar Cipher Example

**Original Message:** `hello`
**Shift:** `3`
**Encoded Message:** `khoor`

## 📁 Files

* `main.py` — The main game logic and user interface.
* `art.py` *(optional)* — Contains ASCII art logo to make the CLI interface more visually appealing.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed

### Run the Game

Clone the repository or download the files, then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📸 Screenshots

*(Optional - Add a screenshot or terminal snippet of the program in action)*

## 📚 Concepts Learned

* How the Caesar Cipher works
* Function definitions and reusability
* Modular programming (splitting code into multiple files)
* User input validation
